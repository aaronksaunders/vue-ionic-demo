# Vuejs and Ionic Components

A Vue.js project showing integration with Ionic Components
* Creating Form Inputs w/ text and options
* Using Ionic Card and List Components
* Integrating Vuex for state management 

Did run into an issue using the `ion-select` component and I opened an issue here, hopefully I will get a response to complete the example

[Issue: ion-select not functioning properly in vuejs](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/14040)
